We currently have switchkit.js that uses sk_proxy_client.js.
So the apps will use a proxy to talk with LLC.
This will simplify things as we will not have to deal with issues to install SwitchKit libs 
and its dependencies.

So, these could have been implemented as a single module.
However, the plan is to eventually allow switchkit.js to use a module that uses switchkit libraries to talk with LLC.
